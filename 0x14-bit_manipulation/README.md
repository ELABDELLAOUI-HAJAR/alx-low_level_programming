# welcome to this directory where we will practice the concept of bit manipulation

| task | Description |
| ---- | ------------ |
| 0-binary_to_uint.c | A function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int and returns the converted number, or 0 if<br/>- There is one or more chars in the string b that is not 0 or 1.<br/>- b is NULL. |
| 1-print_binary.c | A function that prints the binary representation of a number. |
| 2-get_bit.c | A function that returns the value of a bit at a given index. |
| 3-set_bit.c | A function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index and returns: 1 if it worked, or -1 if an error occurred. |
| 4-clear_bit.c | A function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index and returns: 1 if it worked, or -1 if an error occurred. |
| 5-flip_bits.c | A function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another without using the % or / operators. |
| 100-get_endianness.c | A function that checks the endianness and returns: 0 if big endian, 1 if little endian. (endianness is the order or sequence of bytes of a word of digital data in computer memory) |
| 101-password | get a password to crackme3.<br/> I use gdb to get the password : first i found that the length of the password is 4 than from the compare byte by byte i found the four needed bytes.'Hol4' than I create a C program to generate the password file because the 4 should be in the ascii code. |
